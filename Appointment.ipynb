    "# üõ†Ô∏è Automating Tomorrow's Appointments with Python! üêçüìÖ\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you managing appointment schedules and looking for a simple way to automate filtering for next-day appointments? Here's a Python function I wrote to make it easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìã What Does the Function Do?\n",
    "1. Reads Appointment Data: It reads a CSV file containing appointment information (e.g., patient details, appointment date/time, etc.).\n",
    "2. Filters for Tomorrow's Appointments: Only includes appointments scheduled for the next day.\n",
    "3. Formats Dates and Times: Ensures dates are in DD-MM-YYYY format and times in HH:MM format for clarity.\n",
    "4. Exports to Excel: Saves the filtered and sorted appointments to an easy-to-share Excel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßë‚Äçüíª Key Features:\n",
    "- **Handles Errors Gracefully:** Includes checks for missing files, empty data, and unexpected issues.\n",
    "- **User-Friendly:** Just provide the source file path and destination file path when prompted.\n",
    "- **Automated Sorting:** Sorts the appointments by time so you can quickly glance at the schedule.\n"
